**Stock Picker**

The third project on Basic Ruby Project.

This project implements a method where it takes an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. An algorithm decides which day is the best to buy and the best to sell. It must return a pair of days with a representation thereof, taking the best profit overall. The catch is we need to buy before we can sell. All in the given number of stock prices, also representing the day on which the prices are sorted.
