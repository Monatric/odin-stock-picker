For the first iteration 1st level, element 0 is taken, then proceeds with another iteration in 2nd level,
that starts at element index+1. So, first_level_index0 and second_level_index1 are subtracted together.

The difference is then used with #abs to get the absolute value, in case of negative integers

Then it goes first_level_index0 - second_level_index2, then second_level_index3, and so forth.

After the second level iteration runs out of elements, first level iteration goes up an index

Then it becomes first_level_index1 - second_level_index2, second_level_index3, so forth.

Per first_level_index and second_level_index, return that as a key in a hash,
and the difference as its value

The entire result of all iterations returns a hash full of pair of days and the difference
as their key value pairs respectively.

Iterate over the hash and find the highest value, as that indicates the highest profit of all pair of days.
